NOTES FOR REVIEWER
------------------
- All tools are annotated with `readOnlyHint: true`. See ANNOTATION_JUSTIFICATIONS.txt
  for a detailed explanation of why this is appropriate.
- The app performs internal usage logging (analytics) but this does not modify any
  user-visible external state.
- The widget uses localStorage only for widget ID persistence (session continuity).
- No user authentication is required to use the app through ChatGPT.
- The web pages (login, signup, dashboard) are for the companion website and are
  not required for ChatGPT app functionality.
